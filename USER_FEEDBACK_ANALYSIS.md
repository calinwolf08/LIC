# User Feedback Analysis

Parsed and clarified from user testing session.

---

## BUGS

- [x] **B1: Health System delete not working** - Clicking delete button has no effect. Possibly due to dependencies (preceptors/sites linked to the health system), but no error message or explanation shown to user. *(Location: Health Systems page)*
- [x] **B2: "Loading teams" shown indefinitely** - Shows "loading teams" even when there are no teams. Appears to be stuck loading forever rather than showing empty state. *(Location: Teams management)*
- [x] **B3: Calendar date filter defaults to single month** - Filter defaults to a single month instead of the full schedule window. Should default to show the entire schedule date range. *(Location: Schedules calendar view)*

## FEATURE REQUESTS

### Availability & Time Management

- [ ] **F1: AM/PM time slots for availability** - Allow preceptors to mark availability for mornings or afternoons only, not just full days. Enables half-day scheduling. *(Priority: High)*
- [ ] **F2: Half-day student assignments** - Support assigning students to one preceptor in AM and another in PM, based on preceptor half-day availability. *(Priority: High)*
- [ ] **F3: Notes on availability** - Free-text notes field for availability (e.g., "starts at 9am", "no Wednesdays after 2pm", "prefers mornings"). *(Priority: Medium)*
- [ ] **F4: Availability indicator on preceptor table** - Visual indicator showing whether a preceptor has availability configured. Makes it clear when user still needs to set up availability. *(Priority: Medium)*
- [ ] **F5: Preceptor availability calendar view** - Calendar visualization showing when each preceptor is available (highlight available days). Useful for tracking even without auto-generation. *(Priority: Medium)*

### Scheduling & Assignments

- [ ] **F6: Preset/locked student assignments** - Allow users to pre-create assignments (student A with preceptor B at site C for clerkship D during week E) before running generation. Algorithm should work around these locked assignments. Should validate the assignment is valid, or allow user to override validation. *(Priority: High)*
- [ ] **F7: Block-based scheduling for clerkships** - Some clerkships require consecutive day blocks (e.g., 6 weeks in Surgery). Clerkship config should specify required block size. Algorithm should: (1) assign complete blocks to students, (2) not assign partial blocks that don't satisfy requirements, (3) notify user if partial block is only option. Example: 14-week preceptor availability → assign 6-week block to student 1, 6-week block to student 2, leave 2-week remainder unassigned unless no other option. *(Priority: High)*
- [ ] **F8: Scheduling readiness indicator** - Clear UI indication of whether each entity (preceptor, clerkship, etc.) is ready for schedule generation. Show what's missing (no availability, no team assigned, etc.). Prevent confusion when generation returns 0 results. *(Priority: High)*

### Navigation & Workflow

- [ ] **F9: Edit site inline from preceptor form** - When creating/editing a preceptor, allow quick-editing the linked site without losing preceptor form data. User encountered site with wrong health system and had to abandon preceptor creation to fix it. *(Priority: Medium)*
- [ ] **F10: Streamlined clerkship → team → clerkship flow** - When on clerkship config, clicking "manage teams" should allow adding a team and returning to clerkship config seamlessly. Current flow requires manual navigation back. *(Priority: Medium)*
- [ ] **F11: Preceptor creation wizard with availability** - Consider making preceptor creation a full page (not modal) with availability setup as part of the wizard. Ensures availability is configured during creation, not forgotten. *(Priority: Medium)*

## UX/UI IMPROVEMENTS

### Authentication & Onboarding

- [x] **U1: Password placeholder confusion** - User thought placeholder text in password field was actual text and tried to edit it instead of typing their password. *(Fix: Use clearer placeholder or password dots, consider "Enter password" as placeholder with proper styling)*

### Terminology & Clarity

- [x] **U2: "Scheduling strategy" options unclear** - Clerkship config has scheduling strategy dropdown but options' meanings and impact on schedule aren't explained. *(Fix: Add tooltips or help text explaining each strategy option and when to use it)*
- [x] **U3: "Fallback" terminology confusing** - User didn't understand this refers to backup preceptor when primary can't cover entire requirement. *(Fix: Rename to "Backup Preceptor" or add explanation: "Used when primary preceptor is unavailable")*
- [ ] **U4: Team concept not explained** - Users don't understand: (1) why teams exist, (2) that even single preceptors need a team, (3) that no team = preceptor excluded from scheduling. This is a critical gap. *(Fix: Add prominent explanation. Consider: "Teams group preceptors for scheduling. Every preceptor must belong to at least one team to be included in schedule generation.")*
- [x] **U5: "Associated sites" label confusing** - Label is unclear in context. *(Fix: Rename to something more descriptive like "Sites where this preceptor works" or "Assigned sites")*
- [ ] **U6: "Schedule" vs "Calendar" route confusion** - User went to /schedules expecting to generate a schedule. Didn't realize /schedules is for creating schedule periods and /calendar shows results. *(Fix: Rename routes or add clearer labels. "Schedule Periods" vs "Schedule Calendar"? Or consolidate into single scheduling hub.)*
- [ ] **U7: Availability is required but not obvious** - User didn't know availability must be set for preceptors to be included in generation. Not clear during creation or on preceptor list. *(Fix: Add required indicator, include in creation flow, show warning on preceptor table for those without availability)*

### Forms & Input

- [x] **U8: Redundant site creation buttons** - Site list page has two buttons that both create a site but with different text. Confusing. *(Fix: Use single button, or ensure both have identical text)*
- [ ] **U9: No unsaved changes warning** - User closed preceptor creation modal, went to edit a site, then had to re-enter all preceptor information. Lost work. *(Fix: Add "You have unsaved changes" warning on close. Or auto-save draft. Or allow inline site editing without leaving form.)*
- [ ] **U10: Site hierarchy expectation mismatch** - User expected to create a main site with sub-sites underneath. Current design: each location is a separate site entity. *(Fix: Add explanatory text: "Each clinical location should be its own site. Sites are grouped by Health System.")*
- [ ] **U11: Dropdown vs text input confusion** - User tried typing site name in preceptor form instead of using dropdown. Didn't realize no sites existed yet. *(Fix: Add "No sites found - create one first" message in empty dropdown. Or allow inline site creation.)*

### Navigation & Workflow

- [ ] **U12: Expected setup order not clear** - User went to preceptors first (not the expected order based on sidebar). No guidance on recommended setup sequence. *(Fix: Add onboarding flow or setup checklist: "1. Create Health Systems → 2. Create Sites → 3. Add Preceptors → 4. Create Teams → 5. Configure Clerkships")*
- [ ] **U13: Manage Teams navigation is dead-end** - Clicking "Manage Teams" from clerkship goes to teams page but no easy way back to clerkship config. Hard to complete the workflow. *(Fix: Add breadcrumb, "back to clerkship" link, or handle team selection inline)*
- [ ] **U14: Availability not shown on preceptor popup** - When viewing preceptor details, availability isn't immediately visible. User had to hunt for it. *(Fix: Show availability summary in preceptor detail view/popup)*

### Calendar & Filtering

- [x] **U15: Calendar filter not obviously a filter** - User wasn't clear the controls were filters at all. *(Fix: Add "Filter" label, use collapsible filter panel, or add filter icon)*
- [ ] **U16: Calendar filter misleads about generation scope** - User filtered to single clerkship and expected only that clerkship to be generated. Filter only affects view, not generation. *(Fix: Add clear label: "Display Filter (does not affect schedule generation)" or separate generation options from view filters)*

### Critical Issues (Address First)

These cause the most user confusion and friction:

1. **U4: Team concept not explained** - Users don't understand teams are required, leading to empty schedules
2. **F8: Scheduling readiness indicator** - Users try to generate without proper setup, get 0 results, don't know why
3. **U7: Availability requirement not obvious** - Same issue, preceptors without availability silently excluded
4. ~~**B1: Health System delete not working** - Broken functionality with no feedback~~ ✓ FIXED
5. **U9: No unsaved changes warning** - Users losing work

### High-Value Features

1. **F6: Preset/locked assignments** - Core workflow need for real-world scheduling
2. **F7: Block-based scheduling** - Required for clerkships with consecutive-day requirements
3. **F1/F2: Half-day scheduling** - Common real-world need

### Quick Wins

1. ~~**U8: Redundant buttons** - Simple text/UI fix~~ ✓ FIXED
2. ~~**B2: Loading teams state** - Show empty state instead~~ ✓ FIXED
3. ~~**B3: Calendar date defaults** - Default to full schedule range~~ ✓ FIXED

## ITEMS DEFERRED

| Original Note | Reason |
|---------------|--------|
| "Start trial button" | User clarified this was initial confusion, not an issue to address |
| "Using optional fields" | User clarified no issue - they just didn't understand optional fields were optional |
| "Preceptor shows up for health system in edit page but not main table" | Unable to reproduce, unclear steps. Monitor for recurrence. |
